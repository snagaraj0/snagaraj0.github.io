About me
======
I'm currently an undergraduate at Stanford University studying Computer Science with a focus on AI and biocomputation. Broadly, I'm interested in developing computational methods to improve diagnostics, accelerate drug development, and pave the way for AI integration in clinical settings. Currently, I'm an undergraduate researcher in the [Dror Lab @ Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL)] (https://ai.stanford.edu/). Previously, I've worked as a Data Science/Machine Learning Intern at BigHat Biosciences, a series B antibody engineering startup backed by top VC firms (e.g. 8VC, a16z, Section 32), and as a Software Engineering Intern at Zibrio, an AI-powered health tech startup identifying individuals at high risk of falls. I've also built  directional gene interaction networks at the [Khatri Lab @ Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research] (https://bmir.stanford.edu/), improved drug screening with novel clustering approaches at the [Bogyo Lab @ Stanford Pathology] (https://med.stanford.edu/pathology.html), and created translational clinical tools to diagnose neurocognitive disorders at the [Duong Lab @ Albert Einstein School of Medicine] (https://www.einsteinmed.edu/faculty/16575/tim-duong/).

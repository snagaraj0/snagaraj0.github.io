Abstract
===

MRIs are a powerful imaging tool to help diagnose and treat complex conditions. Since its widespread adoption in
the late 20th century, healthcare organizations have grown more reliant on its ability to guide physicianâ€™s decision making. This has led to these institutions becoming inundated with big medical imaging files that require large amounts of data storage and lead to large operational costs. To some
degree, the introduction of cloud storage has helped offset some of these costs and provide flexibility to this organizations, but there still exists a need for compression methods to further alleviate the burden of this big data problem. To this end, in this work, we introduce a method to compress
MRI images using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and benchmark the performance of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) when trained on the uncompressed images as compared to compressed images for a diagnostic task.
